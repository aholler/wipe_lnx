This directory contains a small test for BTRFS to see if my approach to use
the discard mechanism to wipe contents works with BTRFS.

To conclude, it currently doesn't.

The test is quiet simple. Instead of using discard, I've patched the kernel
to overwrite blocks it otherwise would discard. Then I've mounted a
BTRFS-partition with the mount option discard, deleted a file, and looked
if the contents can still be found.
